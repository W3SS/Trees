Classification And Regression Trees
 
## Overview 

This library supports the construction and interpretation of decision trees
and their ensembles, along with utilities for visualizing trees and generating summaries of data. 

ðŸš§ __WARNING: THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL PRE-ALPHA__ ðŸš§ 

## Usage

```
(require '[trees.dataframe :as df]
         '[trees.tree :as t])

(def iris-data (df/from-csv "iris.csv"))
(def features #{"Sepal length" "Sepal width" "Petal length" "Petal width"})
(def tree-classifier (t/learn iris-data features "Species"))

(t/classify tree-classifier {"Sepal length" 5.2
                             "Sepal width"  3.5
                             "Petal length" 1.4
                             "Petal width"  0.2})
;; => "I. setosa"
```

## FAQ

### What are decision trees?

They are a class of nonparametric model suitable for both classification and regression.

### Why should I use decision trees instead of some other method?

They are interpretable by design and can be very accurate. [Scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) gives
a list of good reasons to use them.
