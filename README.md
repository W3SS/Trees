Classification And Regression Trees in Clojure

## Overview 

ðŸš§ __WARNING: THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL PRE-ALPHA__ ðŸš§ 

This library supports the construction and interpretation of decision trees
and their ensembles, along with utilities for visualizing trees and generating summaries of data. 


## Example Usage

```clj
(require '[trees.dataframe :as df]
         '[trees.tree :as t]
         '[trees.examples :refer [load-iris-data]]
         '[trees.measures :refer [accuracy]])

(def iris-data (load-iris-data))

(def split (t/train-test-split iris-data 0.20))
(def training-set (first split))
(def test-set (df/df->maps (second split)))

(def features #{"Sepal length" "Sepal width" "Petal length" "Petal width"})
(def target "Species")

(def iris-tree (t/learn training-set features target))


(def truth (map #(get % "Species") test-set))
(def predicted (map (partial t/classify iris-tree) test-set))

(def total (count truth))

(accuracy truth predicted)

;; To view the tree:
(require '[com.walmartlabs.datascope :as ds])
(ds/view iris-tree)
```

## FAQ

### What are decision trees?

They are a class of nonparametric model suitable for both classification and regression.

### Why should I use decision trees instead of some other method?

They are interpretable by design and can be very accurate. [Scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) gives
a list of good reasons to use them.
