## FAQ

### What are decision trees?

They are a class of nonparametric model suitable for both classification and regression.

### Why should I use decision trees instead of some other method?

They are interpretable by design and can be very accurate. [Scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) gives
a list of good reasons to use them.
